# Scalable Heart Attack Prediction in Indonesia through Ensemble Machine Learning on Big Data Using Apache Spark

This project explores a real-world health dataset from Indonesia to predict the risk of heart attacks using Apache Spark. It demonstrates the use of big data tools for preprocessing, handling missing values, and exploratory analysis, with the potential to scale into predictive modeling.

---

## 🔍 Project Goals

- Load and explore heart health data using PySpark.
- Handle missing and null values efficiently.
- Understand the structure and distribution of key health indicators.
- Lay the foundation for predictive modeling (e.g., logistic regression, random forest).

---

## 📊 Dataset

- `heart_attack_prediction_indonesia.csv`
- Contains medical and demographic information related to heart attack risk factors in the Indonesian population.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- Python
- PySpark (Apache Spark)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Spark SQL & DataFrame API

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Install Required Tools**
   ```bash
   pip install pyspark
2. **Run Notebook with PySpark**
   ```bash
   pyspark

---

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- Data visualization using seaborn/matplotlib
- Predictive modeling (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees)
- Model evaluation (Accuracy, ROC-AUC, etc.)
- Feature importance analysis

---

## 🧠 Sample Insights (Exploratory)

- Total rows and columns in the dataset
- Null and NaN values across columns
- Initial data schema and types
